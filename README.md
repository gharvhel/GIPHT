## To run
Get an API Key

To use the GIPHY API, you'll need to obtain an API Key by creating an app. Note that you'll need a GIPHY account to create an app. 

Go to https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true to create and app and get API key.

Once you have a key, edit jquery/main.js and replace "Your API Key" with your given key. 

Then open index.html in a browser.

Tested in Google Chrome.
